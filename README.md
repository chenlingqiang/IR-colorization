# IR-colorization


We provide the Pytorch implementation of "Colorization of infrared images based on feature fusion and contrastive learning"
# Getting Started
## Installation
This code was tested with Pytorch 1.6.0, CUDA 10.2, and Python 3.8
## Testing
 ```python test.py --dataroot datasets/ --model COLOR ```
 # Acknowledge
